Abstract--In 2011, Xiang  proposed a deadlock-free adaptive routing scheme in meshes based on channel overlapping. It supports deadlock-free adaptive routing in 3D mesh with only two virtual channels. In this work, we observe that doesn¡¯t implement the deadlock avoidance in 2D meshes. We show the cyclic channel dependencies generated by
 and provide a method to solve this problem.
